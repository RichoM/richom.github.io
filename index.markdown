Here are some things I made.

## Physical Bits

Physical Bits is a web-based programming environment for educational robotics that supports live coding and autonomy using a hybrid blocks/text programming language.

## webots-blockly

Webots-blockly is an blocks-based editor for the Sumo competition in the [Roboliga Virtual 2020](https://github.com/gzabala/RoboligaVirtual). Roboliga is an annual educational robotics event in which argentinian students get together to compete and show their projects. Due to Covid-19 the 2020 event was held online with the help of the [webots simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/). In order to help younger students with their robot programming I made this editor that generates python code from blocks.

## Paper Airplane

This is a simple game about a paper airplane lost in space that has to avoid crashing into asteroids. It's really nothing more than a Flappy Bird clone but I like this game because it's easy to program and fun to play. I tend to use it as a learning exercise whenever I try a new game engine. In this case, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Low Poly Racing

This was going to be a racing game, but I got bored before building the race track so I left it incomplete. Maybe I'll finish it someday, who knows...

## Sunset Flight

Just an airplane flying through the mountains at sunset.

## Terrain Generation

These are some scenes I made while learning about procedural content generation using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Julia Set

An interactive visualization of the [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set). I made this to learn about shader programming.

## Esclava (card game)

This is a card game that my ex used to play with her friends. I don't really understand what's fun about it and I don't remember the rules. The code is a mess, but you could probably get a sense of what the game is about by looking at it. Also, this was a useful exercise to learn about [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## MiniMorphicJS

This is just a very basic and incomplete implementation of the [Morphic UI framework](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/morphic) written in Javascript.

- Links: [Demo 1](http://richom.github.io/MiniMorphicJS/demo.html), [Demo 2](http://richom.github.io/MiniMorphicJS/cards.html), [Demo 3](http://richom.github.io/MiniMorphicJS/puzzle.html), [Source code](https://github.com/RichoM/MiniMorphicJS)
