Here are some of the things I made. Enjoy.

## Physical Bits

Physical Bits is a __web-based__ programming environment for __educational robotics__ that supports __live coding__ and __autonomy__ using a __hybrid blocks/text__ programming language.

## Webots-Blockly

Webots-Blockly is an blocks-based editor for the Sumo competition in the [Roboliga Virtual 2020](https://github.com/gzabala/RoboligaVirtual).

## Paper Airplane

This is a simple game about a paper airplane lost in space. It's nothing more than a Flappy Bird clone but I like this game because it's easy to program and fun to play. I tend to use it as a learning exercise whenever I try a new game engine. In this case, I used [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Low Poly Racing

This was going to be a racing game, but I got bored before building the race track so I left it incomplete. Maybe I'll finish it someday, who knows...

## Sunset Flight

Just an airplane flying through the mountains at sunset.

## Terrain Generation

These are some scenes I made to learn about procedural content generation using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## Julia Set

An interactive visualization of the [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set). I made this to learn about shader programming.

## Esclava (card game)

This is a card game that my ex used to play with her friends. I don't really understand what's fun about it and I don't remember the rules. The code is a mess, but you could probably get a sense of what the game is about by looking at it. Also, this was a useful exercise to learn about [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## MiniMorphicJS

This is just a very basic and incomplete implementation of the [Morphic UI framework](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/morphic) written in Javascript.
